BrowserStack’s Automate product relies heavily on the open source testing tool Selenium. As an SE, you will help prospective customers adapt their Selenium test suites to run on BrowserStack.
In this technical challenge, you must create a Selenium script that does the following:

1.  Creates a local webdriver instance on your laptop
2.  Navigates to www.browserstack.com
3.  Logs into BrowserStack using your personal account
4.  Verify that the “Sign In” button is no longer displayed
5.  Adapt your test script to run on BrowserStack Automate 
6.  Make your script run successfully on these two platforms: 
       - Windows 10, Chrome 70
       - Google Pixel, Android 8.0
7.  Have your test run on both platforms simultaneously
